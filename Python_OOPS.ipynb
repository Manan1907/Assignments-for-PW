        "\n",
        "  o\tObject-oriented programming (OOP) is defined as a programming paradigm (and not a specific language) built on the concept of objects, i.e., a set of data contained in fields, and code, indicating procedures.\n",

        "2.\t**What is a class in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tClasses are blueprint / template for creating an object.  It encapsulates data (attributes) and behaviour (methods) into a single unit. Classes define the structure and functionality that objects of that class will possess.\n",
        "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "3.\t**What is an object in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tAn object is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP). It represents a specific instance of a class, which is a blueprint for creating objects. An object encapsulates data (attributes) and behaviour (methods) that operate on that data.\n",
        "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "4.\t**What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tAbstraction focuses on presenting only the essential features of an object, hiding complex implementation details. Encapsulation, on the other hand, bundles data and the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to protect data integrity.\n",
        "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "5.\t**What are dunder methods in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tDunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__, __len__). They allow classes to define how they behave with built-in functions and operators. When a dunder method is defined in a class, it overrides the default behaviour of that method for instances of the class. Python automatically calls these methods in response to specific actions.\n",
        "-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
        "6.\t**Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tInheritance in object-oriented programming is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or child class) can inherit properties and methods from an existing class (superclass or parent class). This enables code reuse and creates a hierarchical relationship between classes, where subclasses can extend or modify the behaviour of their parent class.\n",

        "7.\t**What is polymorphism in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tIn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling flexible and reusable code. It essentially means \"many forms,\" allowing the same method name to be used for different actions depending on the object type.\n",

        "8.\t**How is encapsulation achieved in Python**\n",
        "\n",

        "9.\t**What is a constructor in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tA constructor in Python is a special method within a class that initializes the attributes of an object when the object is created. It is automatically called when an instance of the class is instantiated. The constructor's name is always __init__, and it takes self as its first parameter, referring to the instance being created, along with any other parameters needed to initialize the object's attributes.\n",

        "10.\t**What are class and static methods in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tClass methods and static methods are distinct types of methods within a Python class, each serving specific purposes. They differ from instance methods, which are the most common type and operate on specific instances of a class.\n",
        "      ***Class Methods:***\n",
        "    1. They are bound to the class and not the instance of the class.\n",

        "\n",

        "12.\t**What is method overriding in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tMethod overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass. This is a key part of polymorphism, enabling different objects to respond differently to the same method call based on their class. Essentially, a subclass can redefine a method inherited from its parent class, customizing its behavior to suit the subclass's specific needs.\n",

        "13.\t**What is a property decorator in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tProperty decorator is a built-in feature that allows methods to be accessed like attributes. It provides a way to encapsulate the logic for getting, setting, and deleting an attribute within a class, without requiring explicit method calls. This mechanism facilitates controlled access and modification of class attributes, enhancing code maintainability and data integrity. The @property decorator is primarily used to manage attributes with getter, setter, and deleter methods. These methods define how the attribute's value is retrieved, modified, and deleted, respectively. By using @property, developers can implement custom logic, such as validation or computation, when interacting with an attribute, while maintaining a clean and intuitive syntax.\n",

        "14.\t**Why is polymorphism important in OOP**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tPolymorphism is crucial in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) because it enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, promoting code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. It allows for a single interface to be used for different operations, while each class can implement it in its own specific way.\n",

        "15.\t**What is an abstract class in Python**\n",
        "\n",
        "  o\tAn abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines a common interface for a group of related classes, ensuring that subclasses implement specific methods. Abstract classes are created using the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module and may contain abstract methods, which are declared but lack implementation in the abstract class. Subclasses are then required to provide concrete implementations for these abstract methods.\n",

        "  o\tHere are the advantages of using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. Modularity:\n",
        "    \n",
        "  OOP enables the breakdown of complex systems into smaller, self-contained objects. This makes troubleshooting and collaborative development easier because objects can be developed and tested independently.\n",
        "    \n",
        "  2. Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Through inheritance, code can be reused, eliminating the need to manually develop the same code multiple times. This saves time and effort, making the program more efficient.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  3. Productivity:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  OOP allows programmers to build programs using existing packages and libraries, which speeds up development and boosts productivity.\n",
        "    \n",
        "  4. Scalability:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  New features and functionalities can be added without major code modifications, making it easier to scale applications.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  5. Security:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Data hiding and abstraction mechanisms in OOP help keep applications secure by filtering out limited data and ensuring that only necessary information is visible to users.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  6. Flexibility:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, providing flexibility in code design and implementation.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  7. Code Maintenance:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  OOP promotes a clear structure and separation of concerns, making code easier to maintain, debug, and update. Changes in one part of the code are less likely to affect other parts.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  8. Improved Readability:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  OOP organizes code into logical units (classes), making it easier to understand, navigate, and maintain.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  9. Effective Problem Solving:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  OOP facilitates the breakdown of problems into smaller, manageable parts, making it easier to design and debug complex software systems.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  10. Data Privacy:\n",
        "  \n",

        "\n",
        "  o\tThe key difference between a class variable (also known as a static variable) and an instance variable is their scope and how they are shared. Class variables are shared across all instances of a class, meaning they have only one copy regardless of how many objects are created from that class. Instance variables, on the other hand, are unique to each instance of the class, with each object having its own separate copy.\n",

        "  o\tMultiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This enables a class to combine functionalities from different sources, creating more complex and versatile class structures. When a class inherits from multiple parent classes, it gains access to all the attributes and methods of those parent classes.\n",

The goal of __str__ is readability, offering a clear and concise description for end-users. If __str__ is not defined, Python falls back to using __repr__.\n",
        "\n",
        "  \"__repr__\": This method provides a developer-friendly, unambiguous string representation of an object. It is called by the built-in repr() function and in the interactive interpreter. The goal of __repr__ is to be informative and, ideally, allow the object to be recreated. It's primarily used for debugging and logging. If __repr__ is not defined, the default representation is used, which is less informative.\n",
